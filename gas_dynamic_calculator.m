% The following code is a gas dynamics calculator

R= 287.05;
C_p = (7/2)*R;

% The temperature and pressure at the stagnation point of a high-speed missile are 942°R and 7.8 atm, respectively. 
% Calculate the density at this point. Take 1 atm = 2116 lb/ft2. (Round the final answer to four decimal places.)
% p = ρRT
ρ = pRT = (7.8 atm)(1 atm)(2116 lb/ft2)(1716 ft⋅lbslug⋅°R)(942°R) =  0.0102 slug/ft3

% Condition 1: At the stagnation point of a high-speed missile where the temperature and pressure are 938°R and 7.8 atm, respectively.
